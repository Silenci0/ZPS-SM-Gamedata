# ZPS-SM-Gamedata
Updated gamedata files for ZPS which includes offsets and signatures all necessary for a working copy of Sourcemod.

The following files have been updated with the latest signatures/offsets:
- core.cfg (disables automatic SM updates)
- engine.sdk2013.txt (core.games)
- engine.ep2.txt (core.games)
- game.zpanic.txt (sdkhooks.games)
- game.zpanic.txt (sdktools.games)

# How To Install
The files are setup in the same directory structure as they would be for a regular sourcemod install, so simply copy the addons folder into your game server's main directory and copy over any files.

As an fyi, if you are using core.cfg for anything or have set the config to use different settings, make a copy of your files before overwriting them.
